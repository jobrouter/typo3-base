==================

This extension uses `semantic versioning`_ which basically means for you, that

*  Bugfix updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bug fixes or
   security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
*  Minor updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller
   tasks without breaking changes.
*  Major updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) includes breaking changes which
   can be refactorings, features or bug fixes.

The changes between the different versions can be found in the
:ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
